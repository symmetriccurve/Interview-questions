#### How important do you think the testing helps a product ? Don't you think a developer will test the feature as it builds ? is there a need for separate QA team ?

#### Do you have any experience working with unit testing libraries what are the sum of the unit testing libraries that you have used ?

I have used enzyme with jest as a unit testing and I am also familiar with react tasting library which has become my favorite way of unit testing React components, While enzyme renders the mock component very similar to how React component is build while the React testing library renders the component as a plain HTML which makes re-factoring the components much easier as long as the functionality of the component remains the same.

while I do the unit testing I do not really look for the code coverage I focus more on how the functionality of the component is been tested which inherently brings up the code coverage, I have worked on projects where the minimum unit testing threshold is 90% across lines functions and branches.
